# JavaScript Data 102
## Three simple data types.

### string
strings are defined either with `'` or `"`.
```

let location = 'Atlanta, Georgia';
```

### boolean
The value of a boolean is either `true` or `false`.
```
const isNew = false;
```

### number

Pretty straightforward but `number` cannot write really, really big numbers.

```

let age be =32;
```
